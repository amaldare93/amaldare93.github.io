## My Portfolio

This will be a personal site showcasing my previous and future work and containing information about me.

This site will be build using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and it will be **SUPER SWEET**.

You can check out the current progress at [Github Pages](http://amaldare93.github.io/)

That is all for now.
